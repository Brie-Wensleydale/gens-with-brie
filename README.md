Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my repo where I store all my workflows!

I wish to make easy and useful workflows where everything is tweaked already, and minimal inputs are needed for good outputs.

I will actively maintain any of the workflows that me and my clients use. I may depreciate some, but those will be clearly marked and will not be removed.

Currently updating everything to Wan 2.2, so consider everything Wan 2.1 depreciated. All the FramePack and Flux Kontext workflows are still used.
