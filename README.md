Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my repo where I store all my workflows!

I wish to make easy and useful workflows where everything is tweaked already, and minimal inputs are needed for good outputs.

I will actively maintain any of the workflows that me and my clients use. I may depreciate some, but those will be clearly marked and will not be removed.

Here's the readmes to some of the workflows.
