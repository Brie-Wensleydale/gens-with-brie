Hello Everyone!

Welcome to my repo where I store all my workflows!

I wish to make easy and useful workflows where everything is tweaked already, and minimal inputs are needed for good outputs.

This is just an unorganized pile of my workflows. I maintain whatever I like to maintain. 

The better / newer workflows I post on CivitAI, here:
https://civitai.com/user/slipperygem

If things are old here, they're probably not maintained. I don't guarentee things will work here, but feel free to try things out!

Cheese and have a good one!
